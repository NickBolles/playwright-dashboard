# Playwright Orchestrator & Test Hub

A robust, scalable, and self-hosted Playwright test orchestrator that provides a centralized hub for scheduling, executing, and analyzing end-to-end tests.

## üöÄ Features

- **Centralized Test Orchestration**: Schedule and manage Playwright tests across multiple environments
- **Rate Limiting**: Environment-specific concurrency controls to prevent overloading
- **Multiple Trigger Types**: Manual, scheduled (cron), webhook, and API-triggered test runs
- **Scalable Architecture**: Separate orchestrator and job runner services for horizontal scaling
- **Modern Web Interface**: React-based dashboard with shadcn/ui components
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful API for all operations
- **Trace Storage**: Automatic upload and storage of Playwright traces to S3
- **Docker Ready**: Complete containerization with Docker Compose

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Orchestrator Service** (Node.js/TypeScript)
   - REST API for managing runs, environments, and schedules
   - Cron-based scheduling system
   - Rate limiting and job queue management
   - Webhook endpoints for external integrations

2. **Job Runner Service** (Node.js/TypeScript)
   - Scalable worker containers that execute Playwright tests
   - Polls job queue and respects environment rate limits
   - Uploads test results and traces to S3

3. **Web UI** (React + shadcn/ui)
   - Dashboard for viewing test runs and results
   - Manual test triggering interface
   - Environment and schedule management

4. **Data Stores**
   - PostgreSQL for structured data (runs, environments, schedules)
   - S3-compatible storage for Playwright trace files

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, MinIO, etc.)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd playwright-orchestrator
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration

Copy the example configuration file and customize it:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` with your database and S3 settings:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "playwright_orchestrator",
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": "your_password",
    "ssl": false
  },
  "s3": {
    "endpoint": "http://localhost:9000",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "bucket": "playwright-traces",
    "access_key_id": "your_access_key",
    "secret_access_key": "your_secret_key",
    "force_path_style": true
  },
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "staging",
      "base_url": "https://staging.example.com",
      "concurrency_limit": 3
    }
  ],
  "schedules": [
    {
      "name": "Nightly Tests",
      "cron_string": "0 2 * * *",
      "environment_name": "staging",
      "test_command": "npx playwright test"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run database migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 4. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

## üöÄ Running the Services

### Development Mode

Start all services in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Orchestrator service on port 3001
- Job runner service
- Web UI on port 3000 (when implemented)

### Production Mode

Build and start services:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Docker Deployment

Use Docker Compose for a complete deployment:

```bash
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:up
```
